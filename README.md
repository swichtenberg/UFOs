# UFOs

The purpose of the project was to create an HTML file to display a journalist's article about UFO sightings. In addition, the HTML file was to include an interactive table of UFO sightings that users could filter by any combination of date, city, state, country, shape.

## Purpose

Users are to enter a value in any of the white text boxes under 'Filter Search'. To apply the filter, users are to push 'Enter' on their keyboard or select another white text box. Inputting values in multiple filters will further narrow the results.

## Summary
While the HTML file is user friendly, the current structure does provide a summary of the data available. For example, the users is not able to see which cities have had the most UFO sightings. In addition, further development of the HTML file may include restricting the text that can be entered into each search field (e.g. allowing only dates to be entered into the date field). Finally, the display of the city, state, and country could be updated to have the appropriate capitlization.
